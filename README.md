# Chattymarkov

## Description

Chattymarkov is a python module that lets you generate random sentences
through a markov chain algorithm.

It is useful mostly for bots which are aimed at learning from user's chat and
generate totally w.t.f. answers.

The library can support multiple databases, especially redis which is quite
suitable to store relevant information for markov chains.
